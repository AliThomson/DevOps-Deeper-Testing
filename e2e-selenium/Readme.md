# Selenium

## What is Selenium?

[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) is a popular open-source UI testing library. It creates language-specific bindings for programmatically controlling a web browser so you can write tests in almost any mainstream programming language, including Python. Letâ€™s look at how you can use Selenium, with Python, to automate UI interactions.

To run Selenium, you'll need a web driver for a browser that you have installed locally. Recent versions of Selenium should install that for you when it runs, but you can find web drivers to download yourself listed [in the selenium docs](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/troubleshooting/errors/driver_location/#download-the-driver). 

## Try it out

This assumes you have poetry installed on your machine; if not, install it [according to the instructions here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). 

The test as written also assume that you have Chrome installed, but offers alternatives for FireFox or Safari if you prefer those.

Set up the project with `poetry install`.

You should then be able to run the existing test with `poetry run pytest` - check that you can see a browser appear and navigate Google without input!

> If you aren't using Chrome, take a look at the `.env` file and adjust the variable to run the browser of your choice.
